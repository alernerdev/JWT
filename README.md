# JWT - Javascript Web Tokens

This project is a tutorial on getting JWT working as shown on the Pluralsight course, 
but I have made changes along the way to stay within the javascript environment guidelines as shown
in pluralsight javascript dev environment course.

The choices made on this project are:

- ES6 with Babel
- Mocha for testing
- Chai for asserts
- JSDOM for DOM testing
- AppVeyor for Continuous Integration
- NPM for Script configuration and management
- nsp for security scan of 3rd party packages
- Chalk for syntax coloring on the backend
- Express as the WEB server
- File watching and automatic test running
- Using fetch feature to make http calls
- JSON Server for exposing fake REST API (full fake REST API with zero coding in 30 seconds)
- JSON Schema Faker for random test data generation (mock) 
- TrackJS for front end error reporting
- minification
- sourcemaps
- gzip content compression
- webpack and plugins
- separate dev and prod configurations
- separation of vendor and app code into separate bundles (with dynamic hash tagged names for cache busting)
